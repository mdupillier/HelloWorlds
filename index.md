#Hello World (s) dot com

Welcome to Hello World (s) dot com.

I've been coding for quite a while, and out of my view, there is nothing but more frustrating than willing to start coding with a new language. There are always on the web multiple sources to start... and multiple ways to get lost. Of course with time, the more experienced you get, the more fluent you will be in with finding your path to the information you are searching for. 

Hello World (s) dot com concept:

I've tried to design this site in such a way that it would have fit my expectations when I started to code 20 years ago as a kid by: * * Offer me the keys of the programming car without having to get the "conceptual" driver licence first.
* Let me experiencing the very basic "Hello World" in any (lets say many at this stage) programming language
* Guide me through the very next step in my learning journey.

No matter who you are, I'll hope you enjoy the tour !
Happy Hello World coding ;)
