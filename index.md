#Hello World (s) dot com

Welcome to Hello World (s) dot com.

There is nothing but more frustrating than willing to start coding with a new language. There are always multiple sources to start... and multiple ways to get lost. Of course with time, the more experienced you'll get, the more fluent you will be in with finding your path to the information you are searching for. But starting a new language is always somehow frustrating, painfull, and time consuming.

Hello World (s) dot com concept:

Hello World (s) dot com comes as the answer to the expectations I had when I started to code 20 years ago:

* Start from scratch : No prerequisite needed to start !
* Give me the keys of the car : I do not want to go for a boring classroom before doing my first drift !
* Guide me through my next step : I love this language, where should I go next ?
