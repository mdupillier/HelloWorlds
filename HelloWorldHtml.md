#Hello World (s) dot com with HTML

Lets have a look first at the boring but usefull Wikipedia definition of HTML :

> HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

Lets try to summarize it from a pragmatic noob coder point of view. Wanna learn programming ? HTML is the language you must start with! Not only because it is the "cornerstone technology" for web development but because you need nothing else than a text editor and a web browser to run HTML scripts. You can do that on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android without installing anything on your computer. Last but not least, you even do not need an internet connexion! Fabulous, Amazing, Crazy :p !

##Hello World (s) dot com in 5 Steps:

1. Open a text editor
2. Past the following piece of code:

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<!--Hello World (s) dot com in HTML-->
	<html>
		<head>
			<meta charset="utf-8"/>
			<title>Hello World (s) dot com in HTML</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<p>Hello World(s) dot com in HTML</p>
		</body>
	</html>
```
3. Save your file with an .html extention ex: HelloWorldHTML.html
4. Double clic on this file !
5. Enjoy the result ;)

##Explaining the HelloWorldHTML.html code:

I told you it was simple to write down some HTML code. But now you realize that you needed 11 lines of code to write down a Hello World! #AreYouKiddingMe ? Well, you could have written down a much simpler piece of code and your web browser would have understood it. You can test this by replacing the 11 lines by only one:

```HelloWorld (s) dot com```

You should get quite a similar result... so Why all these lines ?
As every programming languages there is a grammar to respect.
HTML works with Open & Close tags.

All the content you want to display in your web-page should be included between the <body> and the </body> tag.
The declarations such as the title of your web-page, the key words should be included between the <head> and the </head> tag.
Finally you should enclose your <head>...</head> and <body>...</body> between the <html> and </html> tags.
