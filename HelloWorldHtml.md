#Hello World with HTML

Lets have a look first at the boring but usefull Wikipedia definition of HTML :

HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

Lets try to summarize it from a pragmatic new coder point of view. You want to learn programming ? HTML is the language you must start with!! Not only because it is the cornerstone technology for web development but also because you need nothing else than a text editor and a web browser to run HTML scripts. You even do not need an internet connexion !!! Fabulous !!
