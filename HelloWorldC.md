#Hello World C

Lets have a look at the Wikipedia definition of C:

> C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

Ok, quite a definition... From a noob coder perspective : C & C++ are very powerfull languages. Before the web become mainstream, C & C++ were out of the most popular programming langages on the market. I personnaly love C & C++ programming languages because they are very powerful but also very demanding in terms of how carefully you need to use it.  Should you start with these languages, maybe not except if your target is to jump on the dirt gaming market.

##Hello World C in 6 Steps:

1. Download MinGW : http://www.mingw.org/download/installer
2. Install MinGW C Compiler
3. Update Environment Variables with C MinGW compiler directory
4. Create HelloWorldC.c File
5. Compile HelloWorldC.c File
6. Execute HelloWorld.exe & enjoy !

##Explaining the HelloWorldHTML.html code:

I told you it was simple to write down some HTML code. But now you realize that you needed 11 lines of code to write down a Hello World HTML on the screen! #AreYouKiddingMe ? Well, you could have written down a much simpler piece of code and your web browser would have understood it. You can test this by replacing the 11 lines by only one:

```Hello World HTML```

You should get quite a similar result... so Why all these lines ?
As every programming languages there is a grammar to respect.
HTML language works with Opening & Closing tags.

The tags are the small pieces of codes surrounded with <...> or </...>
* The Opening tag format is <...>
* The Closing tag format is </...>

From a grammar perspective, all the content you want to display in your web-page should be included between the <body> and the </body> tag. The declarations such as the title of your web-page, the key words should be included between the <head> and the </head> tag. Finally you should enclose your <head>...</head> and <body>...</body> between the <html> and </html> tags.
