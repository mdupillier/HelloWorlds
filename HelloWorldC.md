#Hello World C

Lets have a look at the Wikipedia definition of C:

> C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

Ok, quite a definition... From a noob coder perspective : C & C++ are very powerfull languages. Before the web become mainstream, C & C++ were out of the most popular programming langages on the market. I personnaly love C & C++ programming languages because they are very powerful but also very demanding in terms of how carefully you need to use it.  Should you start with these languages, maybe not except if your target is to jump on the dirt gaming market.
